# Bankist-App
<br>
Here's the small APP that I studied from my latest lectures. Firstly you have to login in an valid account provided with a short username and PIN code to get access entire resources in the fictional account bank.<br>
Try these users:<br>
- User1: <code>js</code> PIN: <code>1111</code><br>
- User2: <code>jd</code> PIN: <code>2222</code><br>
- User3: <code>rm</code> PIN: <code>3333</code><br>
- User3: <code>km</code> PIN: <code>4444</code><br><br>
After logged in will be possible to check the following features:<br>
- 1. Account statement in ascending values or date order;<br>
- 2. Display total withdrawal/deposit amount and the total current balance;<br>
- 3. Transfer an desired amount to a valid user;<br>
- 4. Receive loans with the selected amount;<br>
- 5. Close bank account purging from the bank data;<br>
- 6. Time-out session limit (defined as 5 minutes);<br>
And so far...<br><br>
I hope you like this project👍<br>
Try it and Have fun!🎉🥳
